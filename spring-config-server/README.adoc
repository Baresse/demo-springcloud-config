= SpringBoot config server

This server will have the following `bootstrap.yml` configuration file :

```
spring:  
  application:
      name: config-service
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/Baresse/config-repo.git
          basedir: ./cloned
          searchPaths: '{application}'
          cloneOnStart: true

security:
  user:
    name: admin
    password: strongpassword
    
server:  
  port: 8888
```

The backend is served by a Git repository : `https://github.com/Baresse/config-repo.git` and the 
configuration will be cloned into the `./cloned` directory. 

Each application will have the opportunity to deploy their configuration files under their own subdirectory.
For instance the backend repository structure could be like this for a application named `app1`:
 
```
  --/
   |
   |- application.yml
   |
   -/app1
    |
    |- application.yml
    |- application-pprd.yml
    |- application-ctrl.yml
    |- application-dev.yml
    |
   ...
```

== Security for some profiles

In real life project the configuration server will not expose pre-production (pprd) or production configuration to unauthorized users or applications. 

The provided server will protect any profile different from `ctrl` and `dev` using basic authentication.
